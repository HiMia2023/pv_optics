# List of layer names in the device stack. Layer names must match filenames in the
# "refractive_index" folder, excluding extensions.
# Light is incident from the layer at the top of the list and travels to the bottom.
# Each layer has the following properties with the following meanings:
#   "d" = layer thickness in nm or inf (infinity), e.g. for the first and last layers
#   "coh" = coherent i.e. interference is relevant in this layer (True or False)
#   "active" = layer produces extractable current (True or False), optional [default=False]
#   "d_min" = lower thickness bound in nm for optimisation of layer, optional
#   "d_max" = upper thickness bound in nm for optimisation of layer, optional
# If both d_min and d_max are given, the layer thickness will be optimised using d as
# an initial guess. Otherwise the layer thickness will not be optimised.
